# Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python project that generates strong random passwords based on user input. It allows you to specify the number of symbols, letters, and numbers in the password. The program ensures each password is unique by not only using a new set of characters each time but also shuffling their positions for added security.

## Features
- Generates strong and secure random passwords.
- Customizable: You can choose the number of symbols, letters, and numbers.
- Ensures random positioning of characters for enhanced strength.
- Built using the Python `random` module.

## How It Works
1. The user specifies:
   - Number of symbols
   - Number of letters
   - Number of numbers
2. The program randomly selects the required characters and shuffles their positions to generate a strong password.
3. Outputs the generated password.

## Skills Learned
Through this project, I learned:
1. The basics of Python, including:
   - Importing and using modules (`random` module).
   - Implementing loops (`for` and `while`).
   - Using control statements (`if-elif-else`).
2. Building practical and useful programs with Python.
3. Overcoming challenges as a beginner, such as understanding logic flow and debugging.

## Challenges Faced
- Being new to Python, I initially struggled with syntax and logic flow.
- Understanding how to shuffle the characters while maintaining randomness was a learning curve.

Despite these challenges, this project was a fun and valuable experience. It is practical and can be helpful in everyday life.
