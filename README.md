This is my simple python project which genrates random passwords based on your choice of number of symbol, letters and numbers entered. Everytime when it runs it generates password not only by taking new set of symbols, letters and numbers but also it changes their position in password which ensures the creation of a strong password everytime you need one.
It involves the use of random module of python which helps in the random selection of symbols, letters or numbers.
Through it I learned the basics of python such as (i)use and import of python module (ii)working on loops (iii) utilize effectively the control statments such as if-elif-else.
Faced some challenges as this was just the start of my python journey but was great fun creating the project which can be useful in real life.
